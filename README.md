_Giving life to a user's FreeBSD daemons_

Lets be honest, I never started out wanting to make a process manager... I just
wanted to deploy my code and run my applications.

But I don't want the calling of `sudo` to be part of my deployment strategy, and
none of the other process managers fit my requirements (maybe I missed one - there
are already so many).

## Goals

- Light memory usage
- Dependency free
- Single binary
- Procfile configuration
- Run from crontab @reboot
- Non-forking processes only

## Installation
